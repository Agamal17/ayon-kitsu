Added Auto-Project Syncing Feature by Editing Kitsu-Processor So it listens to zou events

TODO:
Study Postgresql Ayon Schema so I can edit full_update() and full_delete() to update entites without having to delete whole project and create it again.


Note:
Removed Frontend as a request from my studio as all projects have to be synced, not just specific ones. so the current front end was no use.
(could be added again with updates to sync specific projects but now with auto-syncing)
